# Sections

In the header of each slide, you can display the current section to give your
audience some orientation where you are in your presentation.

To define the current section, simply put a first level heading:
```typ
= Introduction

== First slide of introduction
Look at the header!

== Second slide of introduction
Header hasn't changed.

= Motivation

== And now?
Now, we are in the _motivation_ section.
```

**These first level headings are not displayed themselves!**
They only update the section text in the slide header.
