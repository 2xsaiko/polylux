As you can see, creating slides is as simple as using the `#slide` function.
You can also use different
[themes](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/theme-gallery/index.html)
(contributions welcome if you happen to
[create your own](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/themes.html#create-your-own-theme)!)

For dynamic content, the template also provides [a convenient API for complex
overlays](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/dynamic.html).

[book](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book)

[demo PDF](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux/releases/latest/download/demo.pdf)
where you can see the features of this template in action.

**âš  This template is in active development.
While I try to make sure that the `main`-branch always is in a usable state,
there are no compatibility guarantees!**
